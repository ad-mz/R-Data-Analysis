# R Case Studies: Iris, mtcars, and Formula 1 Data

## Overview
This contains exploratory and statistical analyses using RStudio.  
It showcases three case studies:
- **Iris Dataset**: Classification and visualization of flower species.
- **mtcars Dataset**: Regression analysis and performance insights for car attributes.
- **Formula 1 Dataset**: Race performance trends and driver/team comparisons.

The goal is to demonstrate data cleaning, visualization, and modeling workflows in R, highlighting how R can be applied to both classic datasets and real-world sports data.

## Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `dplyr` and `tidyverse`
- **Visualization** using `ggplot2`
- **Regression and Classification** models
- **Markdown Reporting** with R Markdown (`.Rmd`)

---

## Results
- **Iris Dataset**: Sepal length and petal width are strong predictors of species classification.  
- **mtcars Dataset**: Weight and horsepower significantly affect fuel efficiency (mpg).  
- **Formula 1 Dataset**: Performance differences across teams and drivers highlight competitive trends over time.

## Dataset Sources
- Iris dataset: Built-in R dataset  
- mtcars dataset: Built-in R dataset  
- Formula 1 dataset: Custom dataset included in repo
