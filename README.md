# R Case Studies: Iris and mtcars Datasets

## Overview
This repository contains exploratory and statistical analyses using RStudio.  
It showcases two classic datasets often used in data science education and practice:
- **Iris Dataset**: Classification and visualization of flower species.
- **mtcars Dataset**: Regression analysis and performance insights for car attributes.

The goal is to demonstrate data cleaning, visualization, and modeling workflows in R, highlighting how R can be applied to structured datasets for meaningful insights.

---

## Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `dplyr` and `tidyverse`
- **Visualization** using `ggplot2`
- **Regression and Classification** models
- **Markdown Reporting** with R Markdown (`.Rmd`)

---

## Results
- **Iris Dataset**: Sepal length and petal width are strong predictors of species classification.  
- **mtcars Dataset**: Weight and horsepower significantly affect fuel efficiency (mpg).

## Dataset Sources
- Iris dataset: Built-in R dataset  
- mtcars dataset: Built-in R dataset
